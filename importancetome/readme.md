Importance to me: What is important to me. Family is very important to me, 
I'm somewhat of a loner, but I have a big family. I have 2 sons of my own, 
and 3 stepchildren. I had 8 siblings but unfortunately, they, besides one 
of them have passed away. So I have a host of nieces and nephews, which in 
turn gave me a host of grand nephews and nieces. Also numerous cousins 
from  my mother and father's sides of family. So I am very grateful and 
very close to them. I love them deeply.
